		This is an extremely simplified Geiger detector.
		I built it mostly as an exercise to improve my understanding of electronics and Geiger counters.
		It produces an audible click when an ionizing particle is detected by the Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube.

		The J304 GM tube is driven by a modified flash from a disposable camera.
		A string of Zener diodes limits the voltage.
		A connector leading to the output board is soldered across the GM tube's cathode resistor.

		The signal from the GM tube is passed through an RC network before being amplified by a Darlington pair.
		This amplified signal is fed to a transformer, which drives the piezo element.
